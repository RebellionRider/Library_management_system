# Schema for library management system
This SQL code provides a schema for a library management system using Oracle Database. The schema includes tables for books, book copies, branches, members, checkouts, fines, employees, inventory, job roles, and salaries.

The Books table contains basic information about each book, such as its ID, title, author, ISBN, genre, publisher, and publication date.

The Book_Copies table tracks the copies of each book that are available or checked out at each branch. It has a foreign key dependency on the Books table and the Branch table.

The Branch table provides the details about each library branch, such as its ID, name, address, phone number, and email.

The Members table stores the information about each library member, such as their ID, name, contact information, address, and membership expiration date.

The Checkout table records the information about each book checkout transaction, such as the member who checked out the book, the book copy ID, the checkout date, the due date, and the return date.

The Fine table tracks any fines assessed to a member for late returns or other issues. It has a foreign key dependency on the Members table and the Book_Copies table.

The Employees table contains the information about the library employees, such as their ID, job role, name, contact information, address, and date of hire.

The Inventory table tracks the quantity of each book held at each branch. It has a foreign key dependency on the Books table and the Branch table.

The Job_Roles table stores the information about the different job roles available at the library, such as the role ID, role name, and salary.

Instructions:

To use this schema, copy and paste the SQL code into an Oracle SQL Developer or other compatible tool, and run the commands to create the tables. You can then populate the tables with your own data and use SQL queries to extract the information you need for your library management system.

Note that this schema is just an example and may need to be customized to fit your specific needs. Additionally, you may need to add additional tables or modify the existing ones depending on the requirements of your library management system.
